//Begin with the document ready function

    //Checking account deposit function

      //On click of the depositChecking button

        //Get value from the amountChecking input field

        //Take that value and add it to the existing value in the checkingBalance div

    //Checking account withdrawl funtion

      //On click of the withdrawChecking button

        //Get value from the amountChecking input field

        // If that value is greater than the value in the account ignore that action
        // In other words if this would put the account into a negative balance do not allow it

        //Else subtract that value from the current amount in the checking account

    //Savings account deposit function

      //On click of the depositSavings button

        //Get value from the amountSavings input field

        //Take that value and add it to the existing value in the savingsBalance div

    //Savings account withdraw funtion

      //On click of the withdrawl button

        //Get value from the amountSavings input field

         //If that value is greater than the value in the account ignore that action
         //In other words if this would put the account into a negative balance do not allow it

         //Else subtract that value from the current amount in the savings account

// Bonus-- get the two accounts to work with each other and allow for overdraft protection

// Double Bonus-- This isnt very DRY.  Using the keyword "this" see if you can make the withdraw and deposit functions work for both accounts
